# Abstract

This project is an AR creative demonstration. I envision a world where people don't need heavy backpacks or suitcases to store items. Instead, there's a magical cube, somewhat like Doraemon's fourth-dimensional pocket, capable of storing an infinite amount of content without adding weight.

# System requirements

# How to try it

1. Open the app on your phone.
2. Wait 3 seconds, the chair will drop to your surroundings.
3. Up your hand and aim to the magic cube(blue box) with a hand-open-gesture.
4. Grab hand in air to drag the magic cube to your hand.
5. Aim on the chair with your hand in a grab-gesture, release magic cube to shoot the cube towards the chair.
6. If a collision occurs, the virtual chair will be absorbed by the magical cube.
7. Once again, aim and use a grab-gesture to pick up the magical cube that has fallen on the ground. Open your palm again to release the magical cube, and upon colliding with the environment, it will release virtual chairs into the space.
